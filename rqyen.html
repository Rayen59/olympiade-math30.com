            <h2>Med Rayen Bouazizi</h2>
            <p>
                I am a <span class="highlight">3rd-year mathematics student</span> at Lyc√©e Pilote Sidi Bouzid. From a young age, I developed a deep interest in <span class="highlight">computer science</span> and technology. My passion for these fields has driven me to explore various aspects of software development, including the creation of websites and applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past few years, I have worked on numerous projects, gaining valuable experience and understanding of different programming languages and development tools. My dedication to this craft is reflected in the quality and functionality of the websites and applications I build.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developing this site has been a significant project for me. It took <span class="highlight">three months</span> of focused effort to plan, design, and implement its various features. This site is a testament to my ability to combine technical skills with creative design.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest goes beyond just technical skills; I am also keenly aware of technology's broader impact on society. I believe in using technology to solve real-world problems and aim to create solutions that are both innovative and user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I greatly value feedback from users and peers, as it helps me improve and grow in my field. I am thankful for all the support and encouragement I have received throughout this journey and look forward to contributing more to the field of technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any feedback, suggestions, or if you're interested in collaborating on future projects, please feel free to reach out. I am always open to new opportunities and ideas that can drive technological advancement and innovation.
